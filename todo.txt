# Refactoring
Proposition of how the similarity calculation should be performed after the noise removal is as follows:

The similarity calculation methods should be available as the additional parameter for the noise removal methods.
User chooses the desired noise removal method and passes optional parameter which indicates which method
should be used for comparing the original image with the result image (after the noise removal).
If there is no additional argument, the program performs just the noise removal without comparison.
